# Game Of Life

Assumptions Made

- The grid is not truely infinite in in implementation, it is resized if a cell nears the edges.

- The system running the game can understand the character set and print bullet points (to represent live cells

- States would run forever and the console would not be readable, therefore the Game only runs for 20 states
